A much safer replacement of bash rm with **ALMOST FULL** features of the origin rm command.

Mac OS X **ONLY** so far. (Maybe safe-rm could also work on other operating system, untested though :p )

Using safe-rm, the files or directories you choose to remove will move to Trash(OS X) instead of simply deleting them. You could put them back whenever you want manually.

If a file or directory with the same name already exists in the Trash, the name of newly-deleted items will be ended with the current date and time.

## Supported options

For those implemented options, safe-rm will act **exactly the same** as the origin `rm` command

`-i`, `--interactive`

`-f`, `--force`

`-r`, `-R`, `--recursive`, `--Recursive`

`-v`, `--verbose`

`--`

Combined short options are also supported, such as

`-rf`, `-riv`, etc

## Install

Normally:

	make && sudo make install
	# and enjoy
	
For those who have no `make` command:

	sudo sh install.sh
	
Installing safe-rm will replace the original `/bin/rm` of Mac OS X which will be backed up before replacing.
	
After installation, when you execute `rm` command in the Terminal, lines of below will be printed:

	> rm
	safe-rm
	usage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ...
       unlink file

which helps to tell safe-rm from the original rm.
	
## Uninstall

	make && sudo make uninstall
Or

	sudo sh uninstall.sh
